GRADE: 70

COMMENTS:
The program is good but is incorrect.

You need to document every function.                                       -5

The errors:

Only one process should read the command line arguments and process them,
after which it should broadcast them. Your program has every task doing this
and when there's an error it looks like this:                             -10

Primary job  terminated normally, but 1 process returned
a non-zero exit code. Per user-direction, the job has been aborted.

MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 0 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD
with errorcode 1.

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.

These two lines:
   sscanf(argv[1], "%lf", &input);
   sscanf(argv[2], "%lld", &num_intervals);
should be executed by one process, not all of them.                       -5
Your input validation function is flawed. It reports that valid inputs aren't valid:
22026.46579480671365168414 is an invalid input. As a result it cannot
be run with valid inputs and crashes instead.                            -10

//It works on my end???

You should have used strtol() or strtod() to validate the numbers.
