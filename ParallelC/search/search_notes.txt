Checking if the pattern takes up the entire file:
    Each character in a text file adds one byte to a file's size. 
    So if string size is >= file size then its invalid
     **Each character is encoded as at least 2 bytes.**

     Files have number of characters +1 (idk why that 1 is there)

     Silly Errors:

    printf(usagemessage); #This is not how you call a function
    usagemessage(); #This is how you call a function


 while(i < 6)
        {
           bytes_read = read(in_fd, buffer, j + (character_count - 1));
           printf("%s\n", buffer);
           KMPSearch(argv[1],buffer);
           lseek(in_fd, -2, SEEK_CUR); /*I needed to do -2 because after read is done, lseek's position is in text/p + pattern - 1's poisition, need to subtrat 2 to go to the test/p spot I want*/
           i++;
        }
Works.
