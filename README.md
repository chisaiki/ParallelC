# ParallelC

This repository contains various projects that I've completed during my semester taking parallel computing.
Projects range from programs that use the MPI library to Pthreads. 
Some are still a work in progress, as I am trying to improve the program beyond the scope of the project, whether it is to provide a better, more memory efficient solution or to improve readability. 

Please click through the various branches to see different applications and their common software library.

More projects on the way!
