# ParallelC

This repository contain various projects that I've completed during my semester taking parallel computing.
Projects range from programs that use the MPI library to Pthreads. 
Some are still a work in progress, as I am trying to improve the program beyond the scope of the project, whether it is to provide a better, more memory efficient solution or to improve readability.
